# MASH — Multi-Agent Software Harness

MASH is a framework for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) that orchestrates multiple AI personas to plan, implement, and verify software features. Instead of writing code in a single conversation, MASH separates concerns into specialized agents — each with strict read/write boundaries — and manages the full lifecycle from idea to tested code.

## How It Works

MASH uses four specialized personas that operate in sequence:

```
  You ──► /mash init ──► Init Agent     → defines project scope & architecture
       ──► /mash plan ──► Plan Agent    → turns ideas into detailed feature specs
       ──► /mash dev  ──► Dev Agent(s)  → implements features autonomously
                       ──► QA Agent(s)   → writes and runs tests to verify
```

**Init** and **Plan** run interactively in your conversation, asking clarifying questions to refine requirements. **Dev** and **QA** are spawned as isolated sub-agents that work autonomously within defined boundaries.

## Installation

Requires [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and Git.

```bash
# In any git repository:
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmarchevsky/mash/main/install.sh | bash
```

This installs the framework into your project:
- `.claude/mash/` — framework files (personas, templates, orchestrator)
- `.claude/commands/mash.md` — registers the `/mash` command
- `.mash/plan/` — where specs and feature definitions live
- `src/` and `tests/` — where agents write code

Existing files are preserved. The installer only adds scaffolding for directories that don't exist yet.

## Quick Start

```
/mash init          # Define your project, tech stack, and git workflow
/mash plan          # Describe features — MASH asks questions, writes specs
/mash dev           # Implement all ready features (dev + QA agents)
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/mash` | Show dashboard with feature status and next steps |
| `/mash init` | Interactively define project scope, architecture, and settings |
| `/mash plan` | Create new feature specifications through guided conversation |
| `/mash dev` | Implement and test all DEV_READY features |
| `/mash dev 1,3` | Implement only specific features by ID |
| `/mash status` | Show current progress table |
| `/mash update` | Check for and install framework updates |

## Architecture

### Personas

Each persona has a defined role and strict file access boundaries:

| Persona | Role | Reads | Writes |
|---------|------|-------|--------|
| **Init** | Define project scope and technical decisions | Filesystem scan | `.mash/plan/project.md`, `architecture.md`, `settings.md`, `progress.md` |
| **Plan** | Turn ideas into detailed, testable feature specs | All plan files, `src/` | `.mash/plan/features/feature-<id>.md`, `progress.md` |
| **Dev** | Implement a single feature according to spec | Plan files (read-only) | `src/`, `.mash/dev/feature-<id>.md` |
| **QA** | Verify implementation through tests | Plan files, `src/` (read-only) | `tests/`, `.mash/dev/feature-<id>.md` |

### Feature Lifecycle

```
CREATED ──► DEV_READY ──► WIP ──► DEV_DONE ──► QA_PASS ──► DONE
                           │         │            │
                           └─────────┴────────────┘
                              retry (up to 3x)
                                     │
                                  FAILED
```

Features are tracked in `.mash/plan/progress.md` and defined as individual spec files in `.mash/plan/features/` with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
id: 1
title: User Authentication
status: CREATED
attempt: 0
---
```

Each spec includes a description, acceptance criteria, regression tests, and technical notes.

### Git Workflow Options

Configured during `/mash init` via `.mash/plan/settings.md`:

**Branching:**
- `worktree` — each feature gets a `mash/feature-<id>` branch in a git worktree, merged on completion
- `current_branch` — all work happens directly on the current branch

**Commits:**
- `auto` — MASH commits after QA passes and merges worktree branches
- `manual` — you handle all git operations yourself

## Why MASH over alternatives?

Several frameworks exist for orchestrating AI-driven development with Claude Code. Here's how MASH compares to two popular ones.

### vs. [GSD (Get Shit Done)](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done)

GSD is a context-engineering framework focused on preventing context window degradation. It uses ~40+ slash commands, XML-structured prompts, and an elaborate pipeline of specialized sub-agents (researchers, planners, checkers, executors, verifiers).

**Where MASH differs:**

- **Simplicity over configuration.** MASH has 6 commands. GSD has 40+. MASH's workflow is clear from day one — you don't need to learn modes, profiles, granularity settings, or branching templates.
- **Interactive planning, not automated research.** GSD spawns 4 parallel research agents to investigate your stack before planning. MASH's plan persona talks *to you* — asking clarifying questions across multiple rounds to capture intent that no amount of automated research can surface.
- **Clean separation of concerns.** MASH personas have strict read/write boundaries enforced by the framework. Dev agents can't touch specs. QA agents can't touch source code. GSD's agents are role-typed but share broader access.
- **Minimal file footprint.** GSD generates `PROJECT.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `STATE.md`, research directories, context files, summaries, todos, threads, and seeds. MASH keeps everything in `.mash/plan/` — a handful of markdown files.
- **No dangerous permissions required.** GSD recommends `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for frictionless automation. MASH works within Claude Code's standard permission model.
- **Integrated QA with retry logic.** MASH runs a dedicated QA agent after every dev agent, with automatic retry (up to 3 attempts) and failure analysis. GSD treats testing as a post-hoc verification/UAT phase.

### vs. [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)

Superpowers is a composable skills plugin that enforces mandatory process guardrails — brainstorming, strict TDD, two-stage code review. Skills trigger automatically; the agent "just has superpowers."

**Where MASH differs:**

- **Structured end-to-end execution with gateways.** Superpowers enhances how the agent behaves within a single conversation. MASH manages the full pipeline — spec → dev agent → QA agent → commit/merge — with explicit gateway checks between each stage. A feature doesn't advance from dev to QA without passing validation, and doesn't reach DONE without passing QA. This is an execution framework, not a behavior modifier.
- **Explicit feature tracking.** MASH maintains a progress table with status transitions (CREATED → DEV_READY → WIP → DONE/FAILED), attempt counts, and dev/QA outcomes. Superpowers has no equivalent project-level feature tracker.
- **Built-in retry on failure.** When a MASH dev or QA agent fails, the failure analysis is fed back into the next attempt with updated context. Superpowers has systematic debugging but no automatic retry loop for feature implementation.

## Design Principles

- **Separation of concerns** — each persona has a single responsibility and limited file access
- **Specs are the source of truth** — `.mash/plan/` is read-only during implementation
- **Interactive planning** — init and plan personas ask multiple rounds of questions before writing specs
- **Autonomous execution** — dev and QA agents work independently within their boundaries
- **Retry with context** — failed features are retried up to 3 times with failure analysis fed back to the next attempt
- **Framework, not boilerplate** — MASH manages the process; your project's code, structure, and tools are entirely up to you
